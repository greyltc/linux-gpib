 Here are a few examples that shows how Linux-GPIB can be used
 using special features of the driver.
 
 If you have another example and you think it is worth to have it here please let
 me know.

 Of course the examples doesn't make use of any special functionality
 of the driver, I implemented 'compareable actions' to see the special
 caveats with the different access methods.
