I added this little utility program to the package for quick and easy
configuration without fiddling with all teh parameters in /etc/gpib.conf

It is completely written in TCL/Tk without using the ibsh interpreter 

to install the program check the variable settings on top of the ibconf script
normally it should run from this directory

have fun
