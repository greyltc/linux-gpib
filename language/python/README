This is a python GPIB interface to use gpib library calls from python language.
(Quick hacked)

Installation:


1.) copy gpibinter.c to your python Module directory
2.) take care that you have the installed linux-gpib library
3.) add this line to your Module/Setup file:

    ## the GPIB interface
    #
    gpib gpibinter.c -lgpib -lfl

4.) rebuild python.
5.) copy Gpib.py to your python library directory (normally /usr/local/lib/python)


To use the GPIB extension directly the call syntax is similar as in the C library:

  ##
  # Include the GPIB extension
  ##
  import gpib

  ##
  # find & initialize the device
  ##
  device = gpib.find("my_device")
  
  ##
  # write a string to the device
  ##
  gpib.write(device,"A Command_String")

  ##
  # read a 25 byte string
  ##
  result = gpib.read(device,25)

  print 'the result is: ' + result

To use the Gpib Class module see gpibtest.py


Have Fun!
